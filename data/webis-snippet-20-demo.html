                        extant member of the genus sarcophilus. the size of a small dog, but stocky and
                        muscular, the tasmanian devil is now the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world
                        after the extinction of the thylacine in &lt;NUM&gt;. it is characterised by its black

                        when feeding. it is known to both hunt prey and scavenge carrion and although it is
                        usually solitary, it sometimes eats with other devils. the tasmanian devil became
                        extirpated on the australian mainland about &lt;NUM&gt; years before european settlement
                        in &lt;NUM&gt;. because they were seen as a threat to livestock in tasmania, devils were

                        for christian models of the universe in the middle of the century. isaac newton, like
                        many scientists of his time, had derived the laws of gravity with a sort of
                        theologically motivated template in mind. he wanted to show that the solar system the
                        heavens of god was a stable, static, eternal system. a machine that god had set in
                        motion at the beginning of time, and that would still be going round and round in
                        exactly the same way umpteen eternities later. and the laws newton came up with did just
                        that. they were static they were universal and eternal.</td>

                        short course contents list crisis was first used as a specific term in psychiatry by
                        gerald after considering earlier evidence that survivors of severe trauma, such as those

                        response to severe stress, and crisis intervention emerged to detect maladaptive
                        responses to crises and to convert them into effective coping and learning experiences.
                        caplan concept of crisis was influenced by the theories of his time. it relied on
                        concepts of disease rather than health, and on mechanistic theories from freud and
                        general systems theory regarding homeostasis and equilibrium. but these limitations were
                        far outweighed by caplan contribution in emphasising the importance of preventive care,
                        achieving mastery of the crisis, the social, cultural and material supplies necessary to

                        most people can expect, and most people will recover from crisis without professional
                        intervention. however, there are crises outside the bounds of a person everyday
