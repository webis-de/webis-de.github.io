        <p>The Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011 (Webis-CPC-11) contains 7,859 candidate paraphrases obtained from Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing. The corpus is made up of 4,067 accepted paraphrases, 3,792 rejected non-paraphrases, and the original texts. These samples have formed part of <a href="https://webis.de/data/pan-pc-10">PAN 2010</a> international plagiarism detection competition, but were not previously available separate to rest of the competition data.</p>

        <h2 id="download">Download</h2>
        <p>We provide the dataset as a single folder in a Zip archive. Each paraphrase is represented by three files, containing the original text (e.g.: "1-original.txt"), the paraphrase text (e.g.: "1-paraphrase.txt"), and a file containing metadata (e.g.: "1-metadata.txt"), with information about the task identifier, task author identifier, time taken, and whether the paraphrase was accepted or rejected.</p>

        <p>You can access the Webis-CPC-11 corpus on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3251771">Zenodo</a>.</p>

        <p>If you use the dataset in your research, please send us a copy of your publication. If you additionally want to link to the dataset, please use the dataset's [<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3251771">doi</a>] for a stable link.</p>

        <p>The original samples were extracted from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, and range from 28 to 954 words in length. The example below demonstrates one of the cases.</p>

        <p>Sample original text:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"I dipped into these pages, and as I read for the first time some of the odes of The Unknown Eros, I seemed to have made a great discovery: here was a whole glittering and peaceful tract of poetry which was like a new world to me."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Sample paraphrased text:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"I pored through these pages, and as I perused the lyrics of The Unknown Eros that I had never read before, I appeared to have found out something wonderful: there before me was an entire shining and calming extract of verses that were like a new universe to me."</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Sample metadata:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HITId: 10ZS3NUGQA9S3TFNR35JUEVE5BZVJF <br />
WorkerId: A1YBZ0T0FK7IZO <br />
WorkTimeInSeconds: 345 <br />
Paraphrase: Yes</li>
        </ul>
