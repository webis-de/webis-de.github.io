Also, the API provides only information about the available captions, but not the captions themselves. Only the uploader of a video is given access to its captions via the API; we extracted them using youtube-dl. For each video, all manually created captions were downloaded, and auto-generated captions in the \"default\" language and English. The \"default\" auto-generated caption gives perhaps the only hint at a video's original language.</p><p>Finally, we downloaded all thumbnails used to advertise a video, which are not available via the API, but only via a canonical URL.
