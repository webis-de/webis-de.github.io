Information Sciences, 179(12):1822–1843, 2009.). From the AOL log we extracted all queries of the 215 users contained in the Gayo-Avello sample. We removed the few queries that are empty or just a URL (probably submitted by users mixing up the search field with the address bar) and all queries from the 88 users that submitted less than 4 queries in total (too few queries for reasonable logical sessions). The corpus contains a line for each interaction of a user. The interactions are ordered by time. Each line contains a user ID, the query string, a time stamp, and the rank and domain of the clicked result in case of a click interaction. This data comes from the AOL query log. Furthermore, we have annotated each interaction with a mission ID and potentially a comment from our annotators. The values in a line are tab-separated. Empty lines denote physical session breaks (more than 90 minutes between consecutive interactions) or logical session breaks (different search intents in one physical session). The interactions of different users are additionally split by a dashed line.

Note that the mission detection test was invoked on the manually labeled sessions in the Webis-SMC-12 test set. The pdf of our OAIR 2013 paper is included for convenience.

        <p>The Webis-SMC-12 is based on the AOL log query sample used in Daniel Gayo-Avello's search session corpus (A survey on session detection methods in query logs and a proposal for future evaluation. Information Sciences, 179(12):1822–1843, 2009.). From the AOL log we extracted all queries of the 215 users contained in the Gayo-Avello sample. We removed the few queries that are empty or just a URL (probably submitted by users mixing up the search field with the address bar) and all queries from the 88 users that submitted less than 4 queries in total (too few queries for reasonable logical sessions).</p>

        <p>The corpus contains a line for each interaction of a user. The interactions are ordered by time. Each line contains a user ID, the query string, a time stamp, and the rank and domain of the clicked result in case of a click interaction.	This data comes from the AOL query log. Furthermore, we have annotated each interaction with a mission ID and potentially a comment from our annotators. The values in a line are tab-separated. Empty lines denote physical session breaks (more than 90 minutes between consecutive interactions) or logical session breaks (different search intents in one physical session). The interactions of different users are additionally split by a dashed line.</p>
