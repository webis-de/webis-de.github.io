        <p>In order to create the corpus, 4 different categories of the Open Directory Project were chosen: movies, databases, health and recreation. Each of these categories is again consists of up to six subcategories. In the case of movies, these subcategories correspond to six different titles of two directors. The categories were chosen to allow for different settings of experiments. Example for tasks are to distinguish the two directors or to separate web pages about recreation from those about health.</p>
