Research position on Watermarking for Large Language Models at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar
<p>
The Webis Group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar (<a href="https://weimar.webis.de">weimar.webis.de</a>) is offering a three-year research position in a joint BMBF project with the Fraunhofer IDMT and Artifact GmbH. Salary is based on the collective agreement for the public sector in Germany, TV-L 13, 100%. The engagement can start immediately, but we are also flexible if the start date of a suitable candidate is later this year. There is the possibility of further employment in our research group.
</p><p>
The offered position deals with innovations and current developments in the field of Text Watermarking and Large Language Models and is very attractive for PhD students or experienced postdocs interested in innovative and fundamental research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. The offered position is considered as qualification position, i.e., for non-postdocs we actively support to do a PhD (Dr. rer. nat.).
</p><p>
Prospective candidates should have finished either a master or a PhD in computer science, mathematics, statistics or a related field with excellent or very good grades. Solid knowledge of mathematics and statistics is required for this position - as well as very good programming skills.
</p><p>
We are an experienced research group where team spirit and active collaboration are top priorities. We are looking for open-minded graduates, PhD students, or postdocs who want to develop both as researchers and as a person. The working language of our group is English; fluency in German is not required.
</p><p>
We are interested in increasing the proportion of women in computer science research and particularly welcome applications from suitably qualified women. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, color, gender, age, or disability and are committed to a family-friendly recruitment policy.
</p><p>
Interested and qualified candidates are invited to submit their application by March 2nd to <a href="mailto:tim.gollub@uni-weimar.de">tim.gollub@uni-weimar.de</a>. The application (preferably as a single PDF file) should contain the following documents: a cover letter describing yourself and your interests, a detailed CV, high school diploma (Abitur), academic transcripts stating courses taken and grades earned, and a list of publications (if any).
</p>
