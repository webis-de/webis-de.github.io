Research position in Machine-based Argumentation at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar
</p><p>
The Webis group at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar (weimar.webis.de) is offering a research position in the RATIO project LARGA, a joint project together with Manfred Stede (University of Potsdam).
</p><p>
The LARGA project aims to analyze argumentation strategies, and the position offered can be filled by a graduate student or a postdoc. The engagement can start immediately, but we are also flexible if the start date of a suitable candidate is later this year. The project duration is 3 years; an extension is possible and will be pursued. The offered position is considered a qualifying position, i.e. for a non-postdoc we support a PhD degree (Dr. rer. nat.).
</p><p>
Interested and qualified candidates are invited to submit their CV and related academic transcripts by June 26th to <a href="mailto:johannes.kiesel@uni-weimar.de">johannes.kiesel@uni-weimar.de</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Dear prospective PhD student, unsolicited applications to the Webis group (webis.de) are welcome. However, we cannot promise that open positions are available at the time of your application.
<p>
The Webis Group is a tightly cooperating research network, formed by computer science chairs at the universities of
<a href="http://halle.webis.de/">Halle</a>,
<a href="http://leipzig.webis.de/">Leipzig</a>,
<a href="http://paderborn.webis.de/">Paderborn</a>, and
<a href="http://weimar.webis.de/">Weimar</a>.
Our mission is to tackle challenges of the information society by conducting basic and applied research with the goal of prototyping and evaluating future information systems. We are an experienced research group where team spirit and active collaboration has top priority. We are looking for open-minded graduates and PhDs who want to develop both as a researcher and as a person. The working language of our group is English; fluency in German is not required.
</p>
<p>
Interested students should have finished either a master or a PhD in computer science, mathematics, or a related field with excellent or very good grades. A solid background in mathematics and statistics is expected&mdash;as well as very good programming skills.
</p>
