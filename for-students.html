<h2><a id="vacancies"></a>Vacancies</h2>
<p>
Dear prospective PhD student, unsolicited applications to the Webis group (webis.de) are welcome. However, we cannot promise that open positions are available at the time of your application.
<p>
The Webis Group is a tightly cooperating research network, formed by computer science chairs at the universities of
<a href="http://halle.webis.de/">Halle</a>,
<a href="http://leipzig.webis.de/">Leipzig</a>,
<a href="http://paderborn.webis.de/">Paderborn</a>, and
<a href="http://weimar.webis.de/">Weimar</a>.
Our mission is to tackle challenges of the information society by conducting basic and applied research with the goal of prototyping and evaluating future information systems. We are an experienced research group where team spirit and active collaboration has top priority. We are looking for open-minded graduates and PhDs who want to develop both as a researcher and as a person. The working language of our group is English; fluency in German is not required.
</p>
<p>
Interested students should have finished either a master or a PhD in computer science, mathematics, or a related field with excellent or very good grades. A solid background in mathematics and statistics is expected&mdash;as well as very good programming skills.
</p>

First steps:
<ol>
    <li>Ask a staff member to <a href="https://faq.webis.de#how-to-do-onboarding">onboard you</a>.</li>
    <li>Staff only: Setup a CVS client (e.g. <a href="https://faq.webis.de#how-to-use-cvs">Eclipse + CVS plugin</a>, ensure Latin1 encoding). Checkout all modules. Ask a staff member to explain the organizational structure (especially our <a href="https://webis.de/facilities.html#cvs">main files</a>) to you.</li>
    <li>Install the <a href="https://webis.de/facilities.html#webis-cmd">Webis Command</a> on your machine. Among others, you can use this command to checkout the Webis code base.</li>
    <li>Mount the <a href="https://webis.de/facilities.html?q=cephfs">CEPH</a> on your machine. Obtain access to the webis <a href="https://webis.de/facilities.html?q=vpn">VPN</a> for remote access.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your video chat setup works and that you can reach other staff members by the press of a button.</li>
</ol>
