<h2><a id="vacancies"></a>Vacancies</h2>
<p>
Dear prospective PhD student, unsolicited applications to the Webis group (webis.de) are welcome. However, we cannot promise that open positions are available at the time of your application.
<p>
The Webis group is a tightly cooperating research network, formed by computer science chairs at the universities of
<a href="http://halle.webis.de/">Halle</a>,
<a href="http://leipzig.webis.de/">Leipzig</a>,
<a href="http://paderborn.webis.de/">Paderborn</a>, and
<a href="http://weimar.webis.de/">Weimar</a>.
Our mission is to tackle challenges of the information society by conducting basic and applied research with the goal of prototyping and evaluating future information systems. We are an experienced research group where team spirit and active collaboration has top priority. We are looking for open-minded graduates and PhDs who want to develop both as a researcher and as a person. The working language of our group is English; fluency in German is not required.
</p>
<p>
Interested students should have finished either a master or a PhD in computer science, mathematics, or a related field with excellent or very good grades. A solid background in mathematics and statistics is expected&mdash;as well as very good programming skills.
</p>
