Please read them carefully.

In general, we will be accepting two types of submissions. CEUR-WS demands a minimum number of pages for papers to be published in proceedings.

Hence,

SHORT papers should be min. 5 pages and max. 6 pages + unlimited references.

We will send you evaluation results and qrels in mid June. Please reserve some space for evaluation part in your working notebook (paper) for the camera-ready version. You are very welcome to use your team name when describing your retrieval systems.
