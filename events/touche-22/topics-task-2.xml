Why is Linux better than Windows?
</title>
<description>
Being tired of uncontrolled updates, a Windows user is thinking about switching to another operating system, for example, Linux strongly suggested as "better" by a geek friend. The Windows user knows this would cost them some time and effort to get familiar with Linux and decides to search online for more evidence about Linux advantages.
</description>
<narrative>
Given a specific intent to find information in support of the decision to switch to Linux, highly relevant documents should explicitly mention the advantages of Linux over Windows and/or disadvantages of Windows. Relevant documents can be limited to more general overviews of different operating systems including Linux and Windows and maybe not focused on the superiority of Linux only.

Train or plane? Which is the better choice?
</title>
<description>
A frequent traveler (domestic and international) wants to reconsider their preference for taking a plane given global warming but also security issues like plane crashes from smaller airlines. The users want to get an idea of the environmentally, economic, and most secure travel option for different regions around the world (e.g., Europe with some good train systems in some countries vs. the U.S. market with some longer distances).
</description>
<narrative>
A highly relevant document will contrast the eco-friendliness of trains with their current top speeds to figure out distance ranges/circumstances that favor trains over planes and vice versa. Highly relevant documents may also contain the alternative of using a ship for intercontinental travels. Besides eco-friendliness, also comfort, security, or other aspects can be used in the explanations and expert and amateur experience, statistics, and studies should be included. A relevant document will not contain a fully verbalized comparison but may help to collect the needed facts to pursue, for instance, an eco-friendliness or a security-focused comparison at the user side.

Should one prefer Chinese medicine or Western medicine?
</title>
<description>
Given the medical outcome of a recent visit to the doctor's office, a user is looking for alternatives to classical Western medicine. Previous to the medical outcome (potentially months or years before), the user has heard about some amazing results in the context of Chinese medicine. Now, the user wants to learn more about when others favor Chinese medicine and when not. The information need includes a general discussion of the differences and similarities of both treatment approaches as well as opinions and scientific studies on their advantages and disadvantages.
</description>
<narrative>
A highly relevant document will contrast the general ideas of Chinese medicine and Western medicine and will explain for different medical outcomes what scientific studies and personal opinions favor. Documents that "just" give general background information on Chinese medicine and Western medicine or that only compare both options for rather specific disease patterns can be considered relevant.

What are the best washing machine brands?
</title>
<description>
Facing a broken washing machine, a user needs to choose a new model and is willing to reconsider their year-old choice of a brand. Given the current discussions on eco-friendly electronic devices, the "carbon footprint" in form of power and water consumption of a washing machine will also play a role alongside traditional parameters like washing quality, noise level, etc.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents will compare washing machine brands concerning their offers in different price/performance ranges (from entry-level models to maybe even professional machines) concerning eco-friendliness, durability, washing quality, etc. A document is relevant if at least some washing machine brand with advantages/disadvantages is listed or if some few washing machine models are compared but not just on the "technical" specs level.

Should I buy or rent?
</title>
<description>
A person is planning to move out from their current small flat to start a family. Hoping that the new family will stay together in the new place for some longer time, the person is considering to even buy a new home and not just to rent it. However, this is kind of an important decision with many different angles to be considered: financial situation, the duties coming with owning a flat/house, potential happiness living in a property owned by someone else without any further (financial) responsibilities when major redos are needed, etc.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain various pros and cons for buying or renting a home. Particularly interesting could be checklists of what to favor in what situations. Documents containing definitions and "smaller" comparisons of buying or renting a property are relevant. Documents without any personal opinion/recommendation or pros/cons are not relevant.

Do you prefer cats or dogs, and why?
</title>
<description>
A person thinks of getting a pet but is not sure whether they want to have a cat or a dog. They look for advice from others on what is more manageable for a beginner (e.g., what dog breed to favor without any previous experience), whether cats or dogs in general are considered to be more loyal, friendlier, or cleaner, and also what budget needs to be considered finance-wise. 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents will discuss advantages and inconveniences of both having cats or dogs as pets while relevant documents may only contain personal opinions or anecdotes on either owning a cat or a dog. Documents which include only "definitions" of cats and dogs as animals without a clear opinion on them as pets are not relevant.

What is the better way to grill outdoors: gas or charcoal?</title>
<description>
A person having just decided to start their very first grilling season by buying a grill faces the question that cooks have been asking for decades since the first grill went on sale in the 1950s: Gas or charcoal? Obviously a tricky decision that depends on the actual individual preferences. For instance, many say that it is better to get a great smoky flavor from cooking over charcoal.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain pros and cons for both: using natural gas or using charcoal for outdoor grilling (e.g., flavor, ease of use, eco-friendliness, etc.). A relevant document might just contain opinions of people who share their experience with just one of the options while documents that include only definitions of using charcoal and natural gas, in general, are not relevant.

Which is better, MAC or PC?</title>
<description>
A person is thinking about replacing their old desktop machine by a new one. Without any "religious" preference for either the Mac or PC universe, they are willing to consider buying from either "side". For such an unbiased user, the potential differences between Macs and PCs should be highlighted---probably even that some people believe that the best way to describe the difference between a Mac and a PC is that they represent two different ways of thinking.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents discuss differences between a Mac and a PC (e.g., software availability, price range, design, vulnerability to viruses, etc.) and express preferences on the respective differences. Relevant documents may contain user opinions who are very happy or also very dissatisfied with some choice on Mac vs. PC that they made but without longer comparisons of both worlds. Documents that include only historical information (e.g., when was the first Mac/PC available) or documents without clearly expressed opinions or comparisons are not relevant.

Which is better, Linux or Microsoft? </title>
<description>
A user just bought a new laptop and a new desktop PC and now wonders what operating system to actually install. Since they even think about different options, some experience can be assumed but they are by no way experts (e.g., not naming the Microsoft operating system "Windows"). In particular, the user has no experience in running / installing machines.
Before their decision, the users wants to first compare Linux and Windows with respect to software availability, ease of installation, ease of running a home cinema, long-term support, vulnerabilities for online attacks, etc. Ideally, in their journey of looking up information, the user learns something about the technical details of Linux and Windows but also about others' preferences for Linux or Windows and the respective circumstances that lead to the preferences.  
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents show the advantages and disadvantages of running machines on either Linux or Windows and/or discuss technical differences between Linux and Windows. Relevant documents may be "success stories" of newbies dealing with Linux, how someone did setup their home cinema with Windows, etc. but with no clear comparison of both systems. Documents only presenting technical details of either Linux or Windows or documents giving only historical background on the two operating systems are not relevant.

Which is better, Pepsi or Coke? </title>
<description>
When it comes to soft drinks, there are two kinds of people: people who team up with Coca-Cola and those who are Pepsi players. Both Coca-cola and Pepsi dominate the market of soft drinks and pretty much everyone has a preference for one over the other, without knowing the difference. In order to learn more about the two camps (and maybe to be able to choose one side but not for the sake of trolling), the user wants to compare them in terms of nutritional content (sugar, calories, sodium-content, and caffeine), taste (acidity, vanilla-like), number of people who buy Coke or Pepsi in different countries, etc. 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain a comparison of Coke soda and Pepsi soda based on facts (nutrition-wise, sales, etc.) and general opinions from other persons. A relevant document at least states an explicit preference with respect to for instance sugar content or caffeine while irrelevant documents do not come with a preference but for instance only with lists of ingredients.

What is better, Google search or Yahoo search? </title>
<description>
Even though the tech company Google has created a strong brand name with respect to web search (and other things), some people favor the Yahoo search experience, which is powered by Bing since 2009. Without the intent of trolling, a user is considering to move away from the 90%+ camp of Google search users and has heard that Yahoo once was a good search engine. In particular, there might be scenarios where Yahoo search results (i.e., Bing) are still on par with Google or maybe even better. The user wants to know more about these scenarios (and the ones where Google has advantages) in order to decide whether switching search engines (at least from time to time) might be reasonable. Aspects of the comparisons for potential different use cases/scenarios (e.g., general web search, image search, Twitter search, QA platform, etc.) could be: quality of the search results, speed, ease of access and usage, search reliability, privacy, interactive features, etc. 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain user opinions / comparisons of at least Google and Yahoo (or Bing but then stating that Bing powers most of Yahoo's search results) in different scenarios and/or general user share etc. Documents that contain just a comparison of for instance image search abilities can be considered relevant. Documents comparing the Google and Yahoo stock or comparing other non-search issues are not relevant.

<description>
A user needs to buy a new company car and is pretty sure that it should be one manufactured in Germany to impress their customers---still not being sure whether it should be BMW or Audi (Mercedes for some reason already was ruled out). Now, the user searches for technical characteristics and reviews on cars from both brands including price, engine power, durability, ecological impact, reliability, etc. The users hopes to avoid reading through dozens of articles and wants to find one solid review comparing the brands---ideally with an emphasis on the usage as a company car.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare BMW and Audi cars like the BMW 3, 5, and 7 series to Audi’s A4, A6, or A8 series with respect to their aspects like speed, horsepower, price, reliability, etc. It is also OK, if some further car manufacturers are part of the comparison, but BMW and Audi need to be present. Ideally, such documents include recommendations on particular models and a conclusion which of the two brands should be preferred and why in what class (3 series vs. A4, etc.). Relevant documents may discuss cars from either BMW or Audi along some of the mentioned aspects but without a final comparison of an BMW to an Audi car. Documents that include only historical background on the two car manufacturers, or other content that does not help to decide for a specific car model from BMW or Audi are not relevant.

<description>
A 25-year-old has heard from their friends that playing some video games helps them to relax in the evenings. Not having owned a gaming console as a kid, the 25-year-old isn't (yet) "biased" in the Xbox vs PlayStation battle. Event though both consoles offer access to hundreds of games, some of the 25-year-old's friends still said that the consoles differ in terms of price, hardware, available games, user-friendliness, etc. So, to find more "objective" advice online, the 25-year-old searches for documents that discuss the potential differences between the two consoles and their respective advantages to help them buy a gaming console.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare the consoles over different characteristics like usability, hardware, graphics, design, price, technical compatibility, games, etc. Relevant documents may contain only opinions on either an Xbox or a PlayStation.

Many families decorate a Christmas tree every year, which over and over again triggers debates over the family Christmas tree: live or artificial? In a family's discussion in early December, the question again pops up: Is buying a real or buying an artificial Christmas tree greener and more environmentally friendly? The family searches for more information and discussions on differences between a real and a fake Christmas tree from the ecological point of view (e.g., tree plantations cover vast territories of wildlife habitat while artificial trees are shipped long distances overseas (but may be "used" more than once), etc.). 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare real and fake Christmas trees discussing ecological and environmental impacts of their production and shipping and include a conclusion on the issue. Relevant documents may only cover either real of artificial trees' eco-"footprint" or may compare both variants but not with a clear focus on the ecological issue but potentially other benefits/disadvantages. Documents with no comparison or a discussion of eco-friendliness of the whole Christmas event, etc. are not relevant.

Do you prefer tampons or pads?
</title>
<description>
A user wants to learn more about the tampons vs. pads "debate" that involves plenty of opinions. For instance, someone sporty (doing a lot of movements, etc.) might prefer tampons over pads during sports while in other situations it might be different. Looking for other people's opinions, the user wants to gather an overview of what others perceive as safer, more durable, etc.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare tampons against using pads in different scenarios---still, a document might very well just contain an opinion on environmentally friendliness, price, duration, health benefits, etc. Relevant documents may only contain opinions/facts on when to use either tampons or pads while documents that only show background on the product history or ads are not relevant.

What IDE is better for Java: NetBeans or Eclipse?
</title>
<description>
A software engineer has been developing Java software in Eclipse for years, but has heard many times that NetBeans might be more convenient and flexible. To decide whether switching is worth it, the software engineer is looking for opinions about pros and cons of using NetBeans and Eclipse.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare the two IDEs for Java over features such as support of debugging, code completion, version control, license, performance, etc., and come to a final conclusion about which of the two is better in what scenario. Relevant documents may elaborate on either IDE and should contribute to developing a user's own opinion. Ads might be relevant if they provide pros and cons of either IDE. Documents providing some general information about the IDEs or not providing opinions or experience of using them are not relevant.

Is OpenGL better than Direct3D in terms of portability to different platforms?
</title>
<description>
A beginning games developer is still discovering features of the two APIs OpenGL and Direct3D, which are "competing" APIs used to render computer graphics. The developer is now interested which of them better supports cross-platform development in the sense of developing across different operating systems or the effort needed to port code to other potential platforms.    
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents discuss the portability of OpenGL and Direct3D across different operating systems and help the user to compare which of the two allows a better cross-platform development (but also other features might be discussed). Relevant documents may provide information on either API and help to understand whether they support a single-platform or many-platform development (e.g., cross-platform success stories of developers with OpenGL or with Direct3D but not necessarily as a comparison of both). Historical information, ads or tutorials on OpenGL and D3D, which do not share insight on the cross-platform abilities are not relevant.

What are the differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL in performance?
</title>
<description>
Before starting a new DB-related project, a software developer wants to find some tips about when to use which database. Back in their studies some years ago, they had learned that the choice of a database management system is important when starting a new project. Not having too much experience with database-related software development, the user just remembers that historically, MySQL had been a default choice for creating and maintaining databases. Even though the performance differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL have been largely eliminated in recent versions, there still are differences worth considering like usage of indexes, default installation, what types of replication / clustering are available and so on. Getting to know these issues will help the developer make a choice for the project.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents discuss differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL focusing on their performance such as query throughput on what hardware or time to write large amounts of data, but also development and support effort, etc. Highly relevant documents should provide a conclusion on main differences between the two database management systems and about typical scenarios that would favor either option. Relevant documents may help to form an opinion on the performance of either database by for instance describing the usage of one of the systems in some specific scenario(s). Documents discussing the history of MySQL and PostgreSQL, providing materials to learn SQL syntax, tutorials about database usage, etc. that do not elaborate on MySQL or PostgreSQL performance are not relevant.

Is Java code more readable than code written in Scala?
</title>
<description>
An experienced freelance software developer wants to decide whether learning Scala is an interesting option before starting their new project. Mainly being an experienced coder in Java, one reason for switching to Scala in the next project might be code readability to ease discussions with the potential customers who have some basic understanding of programming and who had mentioned Scala in a meeting.  Specifically, the programmer needs to clarify whether Java or Scala code is easier to read also in the scenario of a larger project (i.e., not just readability of "simple" code fragments but also general organization of code files, reusability, etc.).
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain an in-depth comparison of Java and Scala syntax and perceived code readability / understandability for instance giving side-by-side comparisons of the same functionality coded in both languages. Also overview articles like "Java vs Scala: What is the Difference?" or "Scala vs. Java: Why Should I Learn Scala?" or "Java vs. Scala: Which is better?" and other opinions may be (highly) relevant when they discuss Java and Scala syntax + perceived readability / understandability to a larger extent. Relevant documents should at least give some few comparison examples of Java and Scale code fragments or report on experience showing either Java or Scala code to customers (a relevant document might not necessarily have to cover both languages, though). Documents comparing the two programming languages with respect to other characteristics, which do not help the user to conclude about readability of the code, are not relevant.

Which operating system has better performance: Windows 7 or Windows 8?
</title>
<description>
A user running Windows XP is thinking about upgrading to Windows 7 or Windows 8. Having heard some rumors from others that Windows 8 is disappointing, the user is looking to compare the overall performance of the two systems: boot time, program start time, shutdown time, hibernate abilities, perceived speed in general, known bugs, graphics, multimedia, and gaming support.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents include side-by-side tests and reviews of Windows 7 and Windows 8, as well as individual's opinions on experience of using both coming to a conclusion of when to favor which operating system (could even be blog posts or CQA platform entries). Relevant documents may provide tests or experience with just one of the operating systems to at least cover one side of the comparison and help the user form an opinion on either OS. Documents not elaborating on performance but just the GUI, user base, release dates, etc. are not relevant.

</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents include not only battery specifications used in Sony Xperia models and iPhones but also provide data on how much time passes between charges for different usage scenarios (i.e., heavy web access vs. "just" phoning, suggested setups for more expected time between charges, etc.). Relevant documents help the user to form an opinion on either of the smartphone brands by for instance just containing information / opinions / reports on the battery life of either Xperias or iPhones. Opinions and reviews without battery life data are not relevant.

Should I prefer a Leica camera over Nikon for portrait photographs?
</title>
<description>
A professional photographer has spent most of their career shooting portraits with a Nikon camera but has heard from some friend that they love their Leica for portraits. Since the name or logo on the camera is not that important for the photographer, they are willing to give a Leica a try for their next equipment purchase but want to do some general background research on what others think or what reviews can be found online. 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents will support the decision to switch to a Leica or stay with the Nikon in form of stories of photographers having experience to shoot with both, some technical reviews or lists of the best cameras for portraits (all non-beginner models from the two brands can be considered as important). Relevant documents may provide overviews or personal experience of using either a Leica or a Nikon camera for portrait shooting. Documents that describe or compare the brands in general, cameras without a focus on portrait shooting, or the brands history, etc., but do not provide information informing about current Leica or Nikon cameras for portrait photographs are not relevant.

</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents deliberate on the market capitalization of the two tech giants and provide numbers on their market values. Relevant documents may include information on either of the companies. Highly relevant and relevant documents may compare the two or present one of the two by other criteria like number of employees, market strategies, global presence, may include opinions on the future of the companies, etc.; but it is important to contain information about capitalization. Documents describing the history of Apple and Microsoft without financial "details", documents containing experiences of interviewing for jobs or working for the companies, etc. but without data on capitalization or market value are not relevant.

Which laptop has a better durability: HP or Dell?
</title>
<description>
People working from home or freelancing often use powerful laptops instead of desktop machines since they can be carried around between different offices or so. A freelancing web programmer traveling a lot is interested in purchasing a new laptop which will be subject to heavy use. And they already narrowed down the choice to HP or Dell to suit their needs with a main focus on durability since having to work with a replacement machine for some days in case of problems with the laptop is not really an option. 
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents compare HP and Dell laptops with respect to durability and potentially along their other technical characteristics that may influence durability in different scenarios. Such highly relevant documents may include opinions, personal stories of experience of having worked with Dell and HP laptops, but also simply reviews with test setups, etc. A relevant document may discuss technical characteristics, durability and robustness of some specific laptops from either brand not necessarily comparing HP to Dell machines. Reviews comparing HP and Dell, but which do not help the user to decide which laptop is more long-lasting are not relevant.

Which beverage has more calories per glass: beer or cider?
</title>
<description>
Alcoholic drinks on Friday night can often help to relax after a stressful week. However, alcohol can do damage to one's health. Alcoholic beverages are also known to contain high amounts of sugar and are thus not necessarily "compliant" with a healthy lifestyle. A user wants to loose their beer belly and wonders whether switching to cider can be an option. Wishing to compare the caloric content of beer and cider, the user might also be interested in other health-related aspects of the two beverages like sugar and alcohol contents, etc.
</description>
<narrative>
Highly relevant documents contain information about the calories in beer and cider (plus additionally other health related information). A relevant document may provide information on the calories of one of the beverages but not necessarily a comparison of the two. Documents are not relevant if they do not contain information on the caloric content of beer or cider.
