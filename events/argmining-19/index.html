        SECTION Synopsis
        -->
        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis/Call</h2>
	    
	<p>"6th Workshop on Argument Mining", held in conjunction with the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association
	for Computational Linguistics (<a href="https://acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml.html" target="_blank">ACL 2019</a>),
	and chaired by Benno Stein and Henning Wachsmuth.</p>

	<p>Argument mining (also known as "argumentation mining") is a young and emerging research area within
	computational linguistics. At its heart, argument mining involves the automatic identification
	of argumentative structures in free text, such as the conclusions, premises, and inference
	schemes of arguments as well as their interrelations and counter-considerations.</p>

	<p>To date, researchers have investigated argument mining on genres such as legal documents, product
	reviews, news articles, online debates, user-generated web discourse, Wikipedia articles,
	academic literature, persuasive essays, tweets, and dialogues. Recently, also argument quality
	assessment came into focus. In addition, argument mining is inherently tied to stance and
	sentiment analysis, since every argument carries a stance towards its topic, often expressed
	with sentiment.</p>

	<p>Argument mining gives rise to various practical applications of great importance. In particular, it
	provides methods that can find and visualize the main pro and con arguments in a text corpus -
	or even on in an argument search on the web - towards a topic or query of interest. In
	instructional contexts, written and diagrammed arguments represent educational data that can be
	mined for conveying and assessing students' command of course material. In information
	retrieval, argument mining is expected to play a salient role in the emerging field of
	conversational search. And with the IBM Debater, technology based on argument mining recently
	received a lot of media attention.</p>

	<p>While solutions to basic tasks such as component segmentation and classification slowly become
	mature, many tasks remain largely unsolved, particularly in more open genres and topical
	domains. Success in argument mining requires interdisciplinary approaches informed by NLP
	technology, theories of semantics, pragmatics and discourse, knowledge of discourse in
	application domains, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, argumentation theory, and
        computational models of argumentation.
