        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p id="tira-synopsis">The possibility to reproduce and compare results of other researchers is essential
            for scientific progress. In many research&nbsp;fields, however, it is often impossible to specify the
            complete experiment setting; e.g., in the scope of a scientific publication. As a consequence, a&nbsp;
            reliable comparison becomes difficult, if not impossible. TIRA is&nbsp;our approach to address this
            shortcoming. TIRA-jokingly, &quot;The Incredible Research Assistant&quot;-provides a means for
            evaluation as a service. It focuses on hosting&nbsp;shared tasks and facilitates the submission of
            softwares as opposed to the output of running a software on a test dataset (a&nbsp;so-called run). TIRA
            encapsulates the submitted softwares into virtual machines. This way, even after a shared task is over,
            the submitted softwares can be re-evaluated at the click of a button, which severely increased the
            reproducibility of the corresponding shared task. An overview of existing shared tasks is available at
            <a title="TIRA Tasks" href="http://www.tira.io/tasks/">tira.io/tasks</a>.

        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>

        <div>
            <p>TIRA is currently one of the few (if not the only) platform that supports software submissions with
                little extra effort. We have used it to organize 12 shared tasks within PAN@CLEF, CoNLL, and the now
                running WSDM Cup. All told, 300 pieces of software have been collected to date, all archived for
                re-execution. This ensures replicability, and also reproducibility (e.g., re-evaluating the collected
                software on new datasets).</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>For a recent example on applied reproducibility: we hosted a shared task where participants submitted
                software adversary to those submitted to a previous shared task: author obfuscation vs. authorship
                verification. Evaluating the obfuscators involved running obfuscated texts through all of 44 previously
                submitted verifiers to check whether authors could still be identified. This is something that would
                have been virtually impossible without TIRA.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>TIRA<br />- supports almost any working environment and software stack (incl. Windows)<br />- apparently
                does not impede participation in shared tasks<br />&nbsp; (we have so far not observed drops of
                registrations or heard any serious complaints afterward)<br />- prevents participants from directly
                accessing the test datasets (blind evaluation)<br />- prevents leakage of test datasets,<br />- allows
                for controlling the amount of information passed back to participants when they run software on test
                datasets<br />- for the above reasons supports the use of proprietary and sensitive datasets<br />-
                allows for many different task setups (e.g., for the source retrieval task, participants accessed our
                in-house ClueWeb search engine ChatNoir)</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>TIRA's only requirement to participants is that<br />- software is executable from a POSIX command line
                (Cygwin on Windows) with a number of parameters</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>TIRA's requirements for organizers are that they<br />- supply datasets<br />- supply run evaluation
                software<br />- review participant runs for errors<br />- moderate evaluation results and whether it
                should be published<br />- help to answer participant questions as they arise<br />That's nothing more
                than they are doing, anyway.</p>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <p>TIRA does currently not support<br />- GPU acceleration inside virtual machines<br />- accessing
                    cluster computers to run, e.g., MapReduce jobs<br />These are things that will be available
                    eventually.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
            <p>TIRA's operational costs include<br />- running the virtual machines and the servers that host them</p>
            <div>
                <p>We are currently running TIRA on our Betaweb cluster at the Digital Bauhaus Lab (130 machines with
                    64GB RAM each). We can afford to host hundreds of virtual machines simultaneously, and we would be
                    willing to offer hosting free of charge. In return<br />- we'd ask to be highlighted in appropriate
                    places on web pages, presentations, papers, etc.<br />- we'd ask task organizers to make sure
                    participants properly cite TIRA in case they mention it in their papers</p>
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div>
                <p>As a grain of salt: TIRA is still a prototype (beta), and it is rough around the edges in some
                    places. We are working toward an open source release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
