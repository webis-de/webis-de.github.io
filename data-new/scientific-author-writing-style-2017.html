            <p>The Scientific Author's Writing Style Corpus 2017 is composed by 66 experiments in which three evaluators ranked four short text snippets ("targets") with regard to their similarity in writing style to one other snippet ("source"). The snippets were selected from the introduction of scientific articles written by single authors. Additionally, the snippets were manually checked for not having any clear hint on authorship for the evaluators.</p>
