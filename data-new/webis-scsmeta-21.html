For each of the 1044~dialog turns in the dataset, the turn was examined to check if it communicates meta-information on the (desired) results. No distinction was made as to whether the seeker or the provider communicates meta-information, and the annotation was not restricted to instances in which meta-information has a noticeable effect on the search process.</p>
